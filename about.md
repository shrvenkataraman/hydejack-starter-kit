I'm a programmer, researcher, entrepreneur and a quant finance enthusiast.

I am the Co-Founder and Director of Marketing Research at Hankavalshier Food Products Private Limited. 
Previously I worked with PayPal's Risk Product team at Chennai, from 2015 to 2017. 
Prior to that, I interned with PayPal's APAC Technical account management team. 

I started **Hankavalshier's** as a gateway towards a purposeful life. I wanted to introspect, 
think for myself, and see where my life's real purpose is. The last one and a half years
have been an amazing spiritually cleanse. In the process of creating and building up this 
company, I have had tonnes of valuable experiences, met brilliant people, and acquired
the real world street smarts one has to have to thrive as an entrepreneur.The company is 
doing great and is on track with respect to our vision! 

I graduated with a Bachelors and Masters in Software Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology
in 2015 after which I worked at PayPal. While still working at PayPal, I also ran a news/publishing
media start-up called **Highterate**, which I did not commit to due to my work at PayPal, and hence 
did not take off. When the idea for Hankavalshier's came around, I was ready. 

I am currently applying to join a research oriented Masters in Computer Science program, 
specifically to research on challenges related to Large Scale Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
